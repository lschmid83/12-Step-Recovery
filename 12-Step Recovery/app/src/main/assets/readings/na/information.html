	<h3>Information about Narcotics Anonymous</h3>
	<p>Narcotics Anonymous is a non-profit fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem. We are recovering addicts who meet regularly to help each other stay clean. This is a program of complete abstinence from all drugs. There is only one requirement for membership, the desire to stop using. We suggest that you keep an open mind and give yourself a break. Our program is a set of principles written so simply that we can follow them in our daily lives. The most important thing about them is that they work.</p>
	<p>There are no strings attached to NA. We are not affiliated with any other organizations. We have no initiation fees or dues, no pledges to sign, no promises to make to anyone. We are not connected with any political, religious, or law enforcement groups, and are under no surveillance at any time. Anyone may join us regardless of age, race, sexual identity, creed, religion, or lack of religion.</p>
	<p>NA is a global, community-based organization with a multilingual and multicultural membership. NA was founded in 1953, and members hold nearly 76,000 meetings weekly in 143 countries today. <a href="/leaflets/narcotics-anonymous/EN3129.pdf" target="_blank">An Introduction to NA Meetings</a>.</p>
	<p>NA is a completely voluntary organisation. Membership is open to anyone with a drug problem seeking help, regardless of what drug or combination of drugs have been used, and irrespective of age, sex, religion, race, creed or class. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop using drugs. We are recovering addicts who meet regularly to help each other stay clean. This is a program of complete abstinence from all drugs. There is only ONE requirement for membership, the desire to stop using.</p>
	<p>Anyone who wants to stop using drugs may become a member of Narcotics Anonymous. Membership is not limited to addicts using any particular drug. Those who feel they may have a problem with drugs, legal or illegal, including alcohol, are welcome in NA. Recovery in NA focuses on the problem of addiction, not on any particular drug.</p>
	<p>People have all sorts of reasons for attending NA meetings, but the purpose of each meeting is to give NA members a place to share recovery with other addicts.</p>
	<h3>How it Works?</h3>
	<p>We offer recovery from the effects of addiction through working a twelve-step program, including regular attendance at group meetings. The group atmosphere provides help from peers and offers an ongoing support network for addicts who wish to pursue and maintain a drug-free lifestyle. Our name, Narcotics Anonymous, is not meant to imply a focus on any particular drug; NA’s approach makes no distinction between drugs including alcohol. Membership is free, and we have no affiliation with any organizations outside of NA including governments, religions, law enforcement groups, or medical and psychiatric associations. <a href="/leaflets/narcotics-anonymous/AN3122.pdf" target="_blank">Welcome to Narcotics Anonymous</a>.</p>
	<p>We are not interested in what or how much you used or who your connections were, what you have done in the past, how much or how little you have, but only in what you want to do about your problem and how we can help. The newcomer is the most important person at any meeting, because we can only keep what we have by giving it away. We have learned from our group experience that those who keep coming to our meetings regularly stay clean.</p>
	<p>Narcotics Anonymous offers recovery to addicts around the world. We focus on the disease of addiction rather than any particular drug.  Our message is broad enough to attract addicts from any social class or nationality. When new members come to meetings, our sole interest is in their desire for freedom from active addiction and how we can be of help.</p>
	<p>Our program of recovery begins with abstinence from all drugs, including alcohol. Sometimes people come to NA meetings while still using drugs, detoxing from drugs, or on drug replacement therapy. Regardless of what you may be taking when you first come to NA, you are welcome. </p>
	<h3>Meeting Formats</h3>
	<p>When two or more addicts come together to help each other stay clean, they may form a Narcotics Anonymous group. NA groups are formed by addicts who wish to support one another in recovery, in carrying the message directly to other addicts, and in participating in the activities and services of NA as a whole. One of the primary means an NA group uses to fulfil these ends is to conduct NA meetings where addicts can share their recovery experience, thus supporting one another and at the same time carrying the message to others. Some groups host a single weekly meeting; others host a number of meetings each week. <a href="/leaflets/narcotics-anonymous/Group Booklet.pdf" target="_blank">The Group</a>.</p>
	<p>An <b>"open"</b> meeting is an NA meeting that may be attended by anyone (e.g., judges, probation officers, professionals, family members) interested in how we have found recovery from the disease of addiction.  Verbal participation, however, is limited to NA members only.  An open meeting in Narcotics Anonymous allows people from outside of the fellowship to observe what Narcotics Anonymous is and how it functions.  This can be very helpful to those individuals who are striving to reach a decision regarding their personal status as an addict.  An open meeting in Narcotics Anonymous is one method our groups use to achieve their primary purpose of carrying the message to the addict who still suffers.  Some groups also have open meetings as a way of allowing non-addict friends and relatives of NA members to celebrate recovery anniversaries with them.</p>
	<p>A <b>"closed"</b> meeting in Narcotics Anonymous is for those individuals who identify themselves as addicts or for those who are uncertain and think they might have a drug problem.  A closed Narcotics Anonymous meeting provides a freedom that is necessary for more personal and intimate sharing by Narcotics Anonymous members.  It does so by providing an atmosphere in which addicts can feel more certain that those attending will be able to identify with them, and share their own experience, strength, and hope.</p>
	<h3>Sponsorship</h3>
	<p>One of the first suggestions many of us hear when we begin attending NA meetings is to get a sponsor. Sponsorship is a personal and private relationship that can mean different things to different people. An NA sponsor is a member of Narcotics Anonymous, living our programme of recovery, who is willing to build a special, supportive, one-on-one relationship with us. Most members think of a sponsor, first and foremost, as someone who can help us work the Twelve Steps of NA, and sometimes the Twelve Traditions and Twelve Concepts.</p>
	<p>Sponsors share their experience, strength, and hope with their sponsees. Some describe their sponsor as loving and compassionate, someone they can count on to listen and support them no matter what. Others value the objectivity and detachment a sponsor can offer, relying on their direct and honest input even when it may be difficult to accept. Still others turn to a sponsor mainly for guidance through the Twelve Steps.</p>
	<p>Sponsorship works for the same reason that NA works — because recovering members share common bonds of addiction and recovery and, in many cases, can empathize with each other. A sponsor’s role is not that of a legal advisor, a banker, a parent, a marriage counsellor, or a social worker. Nor is a sponsor a therapist offering some sort of professional advice. A sponsor is simply another addict in recovery who is willing to share his or her journey through the Twelve Steps.</p>
	<h3>Service Commitments</h3>
	<p>Setting up chairs, buying literature, arranging for speakers, cleaning up after the meeting, paying the bills, preparing refreshments – most of the things an NA group does to host its meetings are pretty simple. But if one person had to do them all, those simple things would quickly become overwhelming. When group members agree to serve as secretary or treasurer or tea or coffee-maker, that acceptance of responsibility often helps advance their personal growth. It also gives them a chance to help enhance the group’s ability to carry the recovery message.</p>
	<h3>Religion</h3>
	<p>As soon as the word “God” comes up in casual conversation they are inclined to run the other direction. However, it is very important to understand the difference between spirituality and religion before entering into any program of recovery. Groups like Narcotics Anonymous have one goal, and one goal only. They are designed to help individuals get and stay sober. These groups are not discriminating – the only requirement for membership is a desire to stop using drugs. After that, everything else is open to interpretation.</p>
	<p>It is required that when working the steps of Narcotics Anonymous, the individual in question “comes to believe in a power higher than themselves.” Does this mean “God” by religious standards? No. Coming to believe in a power higher than yourself simply means understanding and actively acknowledging that you – in and of yourself – are not the end all be all. Your addiction is more powerful than you are, therefore something outside of yourself must be capable of contributing to your recovery.</p>
	<h3>Anonymity</h3>
	<p>The basic premise of anonymity allows addicts to attend meetings without fear of legal or social repercussions. This is an important consideration for an addict thinking about going to his first meeting. Anonymity also supports an atmosphere of equality in meetings. It helps insure that no individual's personality or circumstance will be considered more important than the message of recovery shared in NA. We ask your help in maintaining our tradition of personal anonymity by not identifying our members by name or in full-face photos as members of Narcotics Anonymous, or by describing details of their personal circumstances, which could reveal their identities. </p>
	<p>In carrying our message of recovery, we welcome articles about our fellowship, but not in terms of personalities. We are not secret, just anonymous. Cooperation by the press has been very good, and we hope that continued exposure given to the Narcotics Anonymous program plays a major role in attracting the many thousands of addicts who need help. We thank you for your understanding.</p>
