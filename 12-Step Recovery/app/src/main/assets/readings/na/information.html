	<h3>Information about Alcoholics Anonymous</h3>
	<p>Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for AA membership; we are self-supporting through our own contributions.</p>
	<p>AA is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy, neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.</p>
	<p>It doesn’t cost anything to attend AA meetings. There are no age or education requirements to participate. Membership is open to anyone who wants to do something about their drinking problem. <a href="/leaflets/alcoholics-anonymous/Who_Me_Revised.pdf" target="_blank">Who Me?</a></p>
	<p>Members enter AA through multiple routes, and membership is diverse. Research has documented a significant correlation between AA attendance and successful outcomes. Those more involved with the AA program tend to do best. </p>
	<p>AA’s primary purpose is to help alcoholics to achieve sobriety.</p>
	<h3>How it Works?</h3>
	<p>AA is a program for living that emphasizes abstinence from alcohol, personal and spiritual growth, and reliance on a higher power of your own understanding which can be anything you choose. <a href="/leaflets/alcoholics-anonymous/p-42_0322.pdf" target="_blank">A Brief Guide to AA</a>.</p>
	<p>AA is nonprofessional — it doesn’t have clinics, doctors, counsellors or psychologists. All members are themselves recovering from alcoholism. There is no central authority controlling how AA groups operate. It is up to the members of each group to decide what they do. However, the AA program of recovery has proved to be so successful that almost every group follows it in very similar ways.</p>
	<p>AA works through members telling their stories of what we used to be like, what happened and what we are like now. The AA program, known as The Twelve Steps, provides a framework for self-examination and a road to recovery, free of alcohol.</p>
	<p>It combines peer accountability, coping skills, and daily connections with 12 actionable steps that are designed to change your relationship with alcohol.</p>
	<p>The Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous are designed to challenge the out-of-control thoughts and behaviours that drive addiction. In clinical terminology, this process is called cognitive restructuring, which means AA changes the way you think about drinking.</p>
	<h3>Meeting Formats</h3>
	<p>AA meetings are held in-person, online, or on the telephone. The members of each meeting decide when, where, and how often they will meet with the format and different rules set out at the beginning of the meeting. <a href="/leaflets/alcoholics-anonymous/p-16_theaagroup.pdf" target="_blank">The Group Leaflet</a>.</p>
	<p>There are a variety of formats for AA meetings and each meeting takes on the feel of their local area. At most meetings you will hear members talk about what drinking did to them and to those around them. Most also share what actions they took to stop drinking and how they are living their lives today.</p>
	<p>Meetings are typically listed as "open" or "closed" meetings. Using our website you can select from accessibility options to search for the type of meeting you are looking for.</p>
	<p><b>Open meetings</b> are available to anyone interested in Alcoholics Anonymous’s program of recovery from alcoholism. Non-alcoholics may attend open meetings as observers but they must keep to the tradition of anonymity regarding anything they hear at the meeting.</p>
	<p><b>Closed meetings</b> are for AA members only or for those who have a drinking problem and “have a desire to stop drinking.”</p>
	<p><b>Online and telephone meetings</b> are also available. Various platforms are used depending on what the group members prefer. Some are video meetings where you see each other’s faces. At other online meetings, everyone's video is off. Still other meetings use a dial-in conference call number. We hope to add a directory of online video meetings to this website soon.</p>
	<p>AA meetings are widely available with an estimated 87,000 AA groups around the world. The estimated membership of AA is over 1.7 million members in 150 countries. Have a look at our <a href="/meetings/statistics">statistics</a> page to see the number of meetings available across the UK.</p>
	<h3>Sponsorship</h3>
	<p>Fun and friendship are a huge part of Alcoholics Anonymous. AA meetings are a great place to meet and socialize with others who are on the same journey. Together, fellow alcoholics hold each other accountable without being judgmental.</p>
	<p>AA began with sponsorship. When Bill W, only a few months sober, was stricken with a powerful urge to drink, this thought came to him: "You need another alcoholic to talk to. You need another alcoholic just as much as he needs you!". He found Dr Bob, who had been trying desperately to stop drinking, and out of their common need AA was born. Dr Bob in turn safeguarded his own sobriety by sponsoring countless other alcoholics. <a href="/leaflets/alcoholics-anonymous/p-15_en_0722.pdf" target="_blank">Questions &amp; Answers on Sponsorship</a>.</p>
	<p>Essentially, sponsorship is one alcoholic who has made some progress in the recovery programme sharing that experience on a continuous, individual basis with another alcoholic who is trying to stay sober. Most present members of AA owe their sobriety to the fact that someone took a special interest in them and was willing to share a great gift with them.</p>
	<p>Many of us found in our early days that we needed close support as we began learning how to "live sober." So we asked an AA member with whom we felt comfortable to be our sponsor. Whether you are a newcomer who is hesitant about "bothering" anyone, or a member who has been around for some time trying to go it alone, we urge you: Do not delay. An alcoholic who has made some progress in the recovery programme wants to share what they have learned with other alcoholics. We know from experience that our own sobriety is greatly strengthened when we give it away.</p>
	<p>Peer support and sponsorship also functions as a safety net, especially in the first few months when cravings are the strongest. Being able to reach out to someone who is a sponsor and has been through the process can save you when you’re thinking about drinking. It is suggested you find a sponsor as soon as possible when you first start attending meetings.</p>
	<h3>Service Commitments</h3>
	<p>None of us would be here today if it were not for the service of those who came before. What can we do today to be of service to the alcoholic yet to come?</p>
	<p>Our Twelfth Step — carrying the message — is the basic service that the AA Fellowship gives; this is our principal aim and the main reason for our existence. Therefore, AA is more than a set of principles; it is a society of alcoholics in action. We must carry the message, else we ourselves can wither and those who haven’t been given the truth may die. Hence, an AA service is anything whatever that helps us to reach a fellow sufferer — ranging all the way from the Twelfth Step itself to a ten-cent phone call and a cup of coffee, and to AA’s General Service Office for national and international action. </p>
	<p>As we work through the 12-Steps, often with the help of a sponsor, we soon find that there are many ways of participating in our service structure.</p>
	<p>Some AA members gain a sense of purpose by showing up to meetings early and making coffee for everyone. Other members do important service work by sponsoring newcomers, sharing their story as speakers at meetings, or delving deeper into the spiritual aspects of the program. <a href="/leaflets/alcoholics-anonymous/3340 Growing into Service.pdf" target="_blank">Growing into Service</a>.</p>
	<h3>Religion</h3>
	<p>AA is not a religious organisation nor is it affiliated with any religious body. It welcomes members of all religions, agnostics and atheists alike. <a href="/leaflets/alcoholics-anonymous/3267 The God Word.pdf" target="_blank">The God Word</a>.</p>
	<p>You don’t have to sign up or achieve anything to be a member. You’re a member of a group if you choose to be. You can come and go as you please. No one is “in charge” of a group. We work through the offer of help and suggestion only. No one can tell you what you should or shouldn’t do.</p>
	<h3>Anonymity</h3>
	<p>Traditionally, AA members have always taken care to preserve their anonymity at the "public" level: press, radio, television, films and the new media technologies such as the internet.  <a href="/leaflets/alcoholics-anonymous/p-47_understandinganonymity.pdf" target="_blank">Understanding Anonymity</a>.</p>
	<p>In the early days of AA, when more stigma was attached to the term "alcoholic" than is the case today, this reluctance to be identified — and publicised — was easy to understand. As the Fellowship of AA grew, the positive values of anonymity soon became apparent.</p>
	<p>First, we know from experience that many problem drinkers might hesitate to turn to AA for help if they thought their problem might be discussed publicly, even inadvertently, by others. Newcomers should be able to seek help with complete assurance that their identities will not be disclosed to anyone outside the Fellowship.  Then, too, we believe that the concept of personal anonymity has a spiritual significance for us – that it discourages the drives for personal recognition, power, prestige, or profit that have caused difficulties in some societies. Much of our relative effectiveness in working with alcoholics might be impaired if we sought or accepted public recognition.</p>
	<p>While each member of AA is free to make his or her own interpretations of this AA tradition, no individual is ever recognised as a spokesperson for the Fellowship locally, nationally, or internationally. Each member speaks only for himself or herself. AA is indebted to all media for their assistance in strengthening the Tradition of anonymity over the years.</p>
