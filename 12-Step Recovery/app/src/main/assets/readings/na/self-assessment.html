	<p>"Am I an addict?" This is a question only you can answer. We found that we all answered different numbers of these questions "Yes." The actual number of "Yes" responses wasn’t as important as how we felt inside and how addiction had affected our lives.</p>
	<p>Some of these questions don’t even mention drugs. This is because addiction is an insidious disease that affects all areas of our lives — even those areas which seem at first to have little to do with drugs. The different drugs we used were not as important as why we used them and what they did to us.</p>
