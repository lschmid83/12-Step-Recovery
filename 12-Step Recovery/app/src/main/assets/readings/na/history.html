	<h3>The History of Alcoholics Anonymous</h3>
	<h3>Early Beginnings</h3>
	<p>The NA fellowship as it is known today was founded in Sun Valley in the Los Angeles area of California in July 1953. Its principles had been first applied to drug addiction at the US Public Health Service Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky in 1947.</p>
	<p>James Patrick Kinnon, known as "Jimmy K.", is commonly credited with founding Narcotics Anonymous (NA) in 1953 in Los Angeles, California, for the purpose of helping its members stop using addictive substances.</p>
	<p>At the time, Alcoholics Anonymous had been in existence for almost 20 years, gaining international recognition for helping its members stop using alcohol. However, AA focused only on alcohol and not drug use. Kinnon recognized the benefits of the AA 12-step program and how a 12-step model could also help those with drug use problems.</p>
	<p>The AA granted Kinnon permission to adopt and change the AA Twelve Steps. For the NA twelve steps, he changed the wording in Step 1 from 'powerless over alcohol' to 'powerless over our addiction.' That is significant as it changed the focus on the addiction rather than on the abused substance.</p>
	<p>Narcotics Anonymous was officially established in Sun Valley, California, in July 1953. At that time, NA was not yet recognized by society at large as a positive force. The initial group had difficulty finding places that would allow them to meet and often had to meet in people's homes. The first meetings of Narcotics Anonymous were held in the basements of churches for the members' protection because at that time an old law prohibiting convicted felons from congregating was still being upheld and churches offered their basements as a sanctuary. Addicts would have to cruise around meeting places and check for surveillance, to make sure meetings would not be busted by police. It was many years before NA became recognized as a beneficial organization, although some early press accounts were very positive.</p>
	<h3>Publications</h3>
	<p>In 1954, the first NA publication was printed, called the "Little Brown Book". It contained the 12 steps and early drafts of several pieces that would later be included in subsequent literature.</p>
	<p>Many of Narcotics Anonymous’s early published works were written by Jimmy Kinnon and are now used globally at over 70,000 NA meetings. He was the key donor to the Yellow Booklet and Little White Booklet used in the 1960s and 1970s. From 1979 to 1982, a group of 1960s and 1970s NA members expanded it to create The Basic Text. The Basic Text was the first-ever known to have been published by recovered drug addicts to treat drug addicts. It was first released in 1982.</p>
	<p>Before the publication of NA's Basic Text in 1982, membership in the organization was low. Once they published the Basic Text, NA grew rapidly.</p>
	<p>The NA White Booklet was written in 1962 and became the heart of NA meetings and the basis for all subsequent NA literature. NA was called a "hip pocket program" because the entire literature could fit into a person's hip pocket. This booklet was republished in 1966 as the NA White Book and included the personal stories of many addicts.</p>
	<p>NA also offers many information pamphlets and NA booklets. In order to help members, these are available in many different languages throughout the world.</p>
	<h3>Growth</h3>
	<p>By the end of 1983, NA had expanded into more than a dozen countries, offering almost 3,000 meetings worldwide. In the 20 years between its founding and publication of the Basic Text, word gradually spread, and meetings began to spring up in several large North American cities. NA also began to receive some international attention. </p>
	<p>The first meetings were fairly sporadic and were mainly restricted to California. Over the next few years NA grew very slowly. In addition, many NA groups were not following the 12 traditions very closely (which were quite new at the time). These groups were at times accepting money from outside entities, conflating AA with NA, or even adding religious elements to the meetings. For a variety of reasons, meetings began to decline in the late 1950s, and there was a four-month period in 1959 when there were no meetings held anywhere at all. Spurred into action by this, Kinnon and others dedicated themselves to restarting NA, promising to hold to the traditions more closely.</p>
	<p>In late 1959, meetings began to form again and grow. The first NA phone line started in 1960, and the first "H&I" group was formed in 1963 (H&I stands for Hospitals and Institutions, a sub-committee of Narcotics Anonymous that carries the message into hospitals and institutions where people cannot get to an outside meeting). That year a "Parent Service Board" (later renamed the World Service Board) was formed to ensure that NA stayed healthy and followed closely to the traditions. Confusingly, in 1962, the Salvation Army started a group also called "Narcotics Anonymous" that followed a different "13-step" program, but this program soon died out. The NA program grew slowly in the 1960s. Members of the program learned what was effective and what was not. Relapse rates declined over time and friction between NA groups began to decrease.</p>
	<p>The 1970s was a period of rapid growth in NA's history. In 1970, there were only 20 regular, weekly meetings, all of them in the United States. Within two years there were 70, including meetings in Germany, Australia, and Bermuda. By 1976, there were 200 regular meetings, including 83 in California alone, and in the early 1980s in Brazil, Canada, Colombia, India, the Republic of Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. In 1980, the first London meeting opened in Millman Street, Chelsea, with around six members and a second followed months later. A World Service Office was officially opened in 1977. In 1971, the first NA World Conference was held, and others have followed annually.</p>
	<p>In the 1980s there was an explosive growth in NA meetings world-wide. There are currently estimated to be 63,000 weekly meetings in 132 countries worldwide.</p>
	<h3>NA in Ireland</h3>
	 <p>Narcotics Anonymous in Ireland began in a very similar fashion to the world-wide fellowship. NA in Ireland can be traced back to 1978 when a group of addicts in Dublin who were attending AA decided to start their own meetings for people suffering from drug addiction. By 1981, there were 1,100 different meetings all over the world and in 1983 Mary Bolton founded Narcotics Anonymous in Ireland.</p>
	<p>These pioneers had no information about Narcotics Anonymous and so their first meeting, which was held in a treatment centre in Clondalkin, County Dublin, and went under the improvised title of Drugs Anonymous. The meeting wrote out a poster with a First Step that read "We admitted we were powerless over drugs, and that our lives had become unmanageable". The group used AA literature and members substituted the words alcohol and drugs for one another. The secretary of this group was Tom C. Sometime in early 1979 some NA literature was received from the World Service Office, and the group changed its name to Narcotics Anonymous. It is not clear how long this group continued to meet. A separate group started later that year, using the same poster from the original meeting, and held a Narcotics Anonymous meeting at the same venue on October 7, 1979, with Mark F. as the secretary. There have been NA meetings held in Ireland continuously since that date.</p>
	<p>Although the fellowship remained quite small for its first five years in existence, Dublin addicts were at last being given an opportunity of finding recovery and getting clean through the NA programme. Meetings also started in Drogheda and Limerick around this time.</p>
	<p>By 1983 there were no more than six NA groups in the country, but then two events occurred that were to lead to the rapid growth of NA within Ireland. The first was the publication of the first edition of the NA Basic Text, which helped cause a worldwide surge in the number of NA meetings. The second was a visit by Irish members to a “learning weekend’ in London. They returned to Ireland determined to create a local service structure, and this led to the creation of an Irish Area Service Committee (ASC), which was set up in a member’s flat in Rathmines, Dublin on May 14th 1983.</p>
