	<h3>Prayer of Saint Francis Assisi</h3>
	<p>
	  Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace!<br />
	  That where there is hatred, I may bring love.<br />
	  That where there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness.<br />
	  That where there is discord, I may bring harmony.<br />
	  That where there is error, I may bring truth.<br />
	  That where there is doubt, I may bring faith.<br />
	  That where there is despair, I may bring hope.<br />
	  That where there are shadows, I may bring light.<br />
	  That where there is sadness, I may bring joy.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	  Lord, grant that I may seek rather to comfort than to be comforted.<br />
	  To understand, than to be understood.<br />
	  To love, than to be loved.<br />
	  For it is by self-forgetting that one finds.<br />
	  It is by forgiving that one is forgiven.<br />
	  It is by dying that one awakens to Eternal Life.<br />
	  Amen.
	</p>
