	<h3>Self Support / 7th Tradition</h3>
	<p>The Seventh Tradition states that Alcoholics Anonymous is self-supporting through our own contributions. The contributions help to cover the group's expenses. But the Seventh Tradition is more than simply paying for rent and other group expenses. It is both a privilege and a responsibility of individual groups and members to ensure that our organization, at every level, remains forever self-supporting and free of outside influences that might divert us from our primary purpose. </p>
	<p>The monetary amount of each contribution is secondary to the spiritual connection that joins us in unity with A.A. groups around the world.</p>
