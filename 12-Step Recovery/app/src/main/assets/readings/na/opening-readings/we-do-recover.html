	<h3>We Do Recover</h3>
	<p>When at the end of the road we find that we can no longer function as a human being, either with or without drugs, we all face the same dilemma. What is there left to do? There seems to be this alternative: either go on as best we can to the bitter ends — jails, institutions or death — or find a new way to live. In years gone by, very few addicts ever had this last choice.</p>
	<p>Those who are addicted today are more fortunate. For the first time in man’s entire history, a simple way has been proving itself in the lives of many addicts. It is available to us all. This is a simple spiritual — not religious — program, known as Narcotics Anonymous.</p>
