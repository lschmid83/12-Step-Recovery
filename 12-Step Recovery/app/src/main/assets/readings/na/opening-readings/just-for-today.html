	<h3>Just for Today</h3>
    <p>Tell yourself:</p>
    <p><b>JUST FOR TODAY</b> my thoughts will be on my recovery, living and enjoying life without the use of drugs. </p>
    <p><b>JUST FOR TODAY</b> I will have faith in someone in NA who believes in me and wants to help me in my recovery.</p>
    <p><b>JUST FOR TODAY</b> I will have a program. I will try to follow it to the best of my ability. </p>
    <p><b>JUST FOR TODAY</b>, through NA, I will try to get a better perspective on my life.</p>
    <p><b>JUST FOR TODAY</b> I will be unafraid. My thoughts will be on my new associations, people who are not using and who have found a new way of life. So long as I follow that way, I have nothing to fear.</p>
