	<h3>The Preamble</h3>
	<p>Cocaine Anonymous is a Fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others recover from their addiction. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop using cocaine and all other mind-altering substances.</p>
	<p>There are no dues or fees for membership; we are fully self-supporting through our own contributions. We are not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization, or institution. We do not wish to engage in any controversy and we neither endorse nor oppose any causes.</p>
	<p>Our primary purpose is to stay free from cocaine and all other mind-altering substances, and to help others achieve the same freedom.</p>
