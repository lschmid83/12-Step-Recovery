  <h3>Alcohol</h3>
  <p>Alcohol is a mind-altering substance in liquid form. Many people donâ€™t realize it is no different from cocaine or other drugs in its ability to lead to addiction. One drink is never enough, just as one hit, fix, pill or snort is never enough. We are masters at combining and substituting one drug for another to get high. Many of us never felt that alcohol was part of our problem.</p>
