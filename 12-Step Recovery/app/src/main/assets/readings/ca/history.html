	<h3>The History of Cocaine Anonymous</h3>
	<h3>Early Beginnings</h3>
	<p>C.A. was formed in Los Angeles in 1982 by the late Johnny Segal and several others. Seagal worked in the film industry and saw a number of people who had difficulty finding help from anyone knowledgeable about the special difficulties presented by cocaine addiction.</p>
	<p>In November 1982, Johnny S. receives a call from Tom K. from the Motion Picture Health & Welfare Fund in Hollywood, California, who plans to start an AA Meeting for drug addicts, especially cocaine addicts. "In those days, you could go to AA meetings and if you talked about drugs, they asked you to leave."</p>
	<p>The first meeting of C.A. is held on Thursday, November 18, 1982, at the Motion Picture Health and Welfare Fund building at 335 North La Brea in Hollywood (North of Beverly Blvd.), California. Veronica Jo K. is the secretary and calls the meeting to order with a gavel and announces: “Welcome to the first meeting of Cocaine Anonymous, a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength, and hope with each other and help others recover from their addiction.</p>
	<p>In November-December 1982 The Beverly Glen Hospital provided a room for a weekly, free “Cocaine Anonymous” meeting open to drug abusers. (This became the 2nd meeting of Cocaine Anonymous and its first H & I meeting.) The group now averages 30 people. Psychotherapist Allan Rosenthal said the response from doctors and other health-care professionals has been “so overwhelming” that he envisions a mushrooming "Cocaine Anonymous" organization in Los Angeles, complete with a telephone hotline, literature and an administrative.</p>
	<p>In February 1983 – The secretaries of the six C.A. meetings got together and formed what eventually became the first General Services Organization and in April 1983, the Los Angeles Central Office was formed.</p>
	<p>In April 11, 1983, Time Magazine Cover features a story on fighting cocaine’s grip on millions of users. The article references Cocaine Anonymous… "In Los Angeles, new Cocaine Anonymous groups draw 700 people to weekly meetings."</p>
	<p>Ray G. is in charge of the Cocaine Anonymous phone number. It rings on an answering machine in a small Beverly Glen Hospital room and Ray G. returns most of the calls. The room and phone machine are provided by Beverly Glen Hospital. C.A. sets up a hotline phone number during the first year. Ray G. manages the hotline for the first year. "If any of you called in the first year of existence of Cocaine Anonymous and talked to the man on the telephone, that was Ray G. - who took all the calls for the first year of Cocaine Anonymous."</p>
	<h3 >Sobriety Chips</h3>
	<p>In November 23, 1983. Gil M. orders 1500 chips. They will be available through the General Services Office for $2.50 per chip. Gil will be responsible for sales. C.A. chips (30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, 2 years — there was no 'newcomer' or 18 month chip) were square in shape, with the letters "CA" printed on them. It was found that people were using these square chips to chop up cocaine. At this same time, some others Area’s of C.A. (of course none of them had met together yet) had also created chips. Atlanta had chips, Chicago had chips, and Northern California had chips.</p>
	<p>The words Hope, Faith and Courage were not the original words for the logo. Originally, the words were going to be "Hope, Faith and Willingness." They wanted to put these words into the circle around C.A., but the word Willingness wouldn’t fit. Johnny Segal, a founding member, was listening to a speech by John F. Kennedy about having courage to do difficult things in your life. Johnny felt the word Courage would fit in the circle, and would be appropriate. The members at the time voted for this logo.</p>
	<h3>Conventions</h3>
	<p>Between May 3-5, 1985, 1st World Convention: Seaside Unity & Acceptance, Santa Barbara, C.A. In 1985 it was decided to have the first convention of C.A. Fellowships to be held in Santa Barbara California. Members from C.A. meetings from across the United States attended. It was an incredibly exciting event. During the convention, a three-hour business meeting was held to let the fellowships know what the fledgling World Service organization was doing. It was decided the next year to have the first World Service Conference.</p>
	<p>The first World Service Conference was held in San Diego in February 1986, adjacent to a World Service Convention. The Conference lasted two days.</p>
	<p>When Northern California came down to this original conference, they sent six representatives and all wearing T-shirts with the C.A. logo that they had created. Later at the 3rd World Conference in March 1987, there was vote between the logo that CALA had created, and the logo that Northern California created. The CALA (C.A. Los Angeles) logo with HOPE, FAITH AND COURAGE won and is the official logo we have today. The logo was to be put on the new key tag round chips. In Northern California created the first metal chip, with their logo, with the serenity prayer (with Cocaine Anonymous around the number) on the back, and ca and HOPE FAITH AND COURAGE on the front. It was an error that the words Cocaine Anonymous were on the back!  Since Northern California had the first metal chip, the chip company would not make chips for CA World Service. So at the 3rd World Conference in March 1987, Northern California deeded to World Service the right to make metal chips.</p>
