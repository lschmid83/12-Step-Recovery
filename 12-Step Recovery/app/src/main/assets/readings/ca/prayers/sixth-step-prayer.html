	<h3>Sixth Step Prayer</h3>
	<p>
	  Dear God, I am ready for Your help In removing from me the defects of character.<br />
	  Which I now realize are an obstacle to my recovery.<br />
	  Help me to continue being honest with myself and Guide me toward spiritual and mental health.<br /><br />
	  God, help me become willing to let go of all the things to which I still cling.<br />
	  Help me to be ready to let You remove all of these defects, that your will and purpose may take their place.<br />
	  Amen.<br /><br />
