	<h3>Promise</h3>
	<p>I put my hand in yours and together we can do what we could never do alone.</p>
	<p>No longer is there a sense of hopelessness.</p>
	<p>No longer must we each depend upon our own unsteady willpower.</p>
	<p>We are all together now, reaching out our hands for power and strength greater than ours.</p>
	<p>And as we join hands, we find love and understanding beyond our wildest dreams.</p>
