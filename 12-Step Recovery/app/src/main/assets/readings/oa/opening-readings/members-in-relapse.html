	<h3>Members in Relapse</h3>
	<p>We all need to be loved and accepted, not because we are abstinent, not because we are at goal weight, but just for who we are. This is especially true for OA members who are still suffering. They have been in the program for some time, perhaps for months, maybe even years, but either they have not yet obtained abstinence, or they are in relapse. When asked what helped them most, people who have gone through this painful experience agree on one thing: being loved and accepted, even when they are compulsively overeating, even when they were falling apart emotionally, even when they felt hopeless and unlovable, was the key to them eventually loving and accepting themselves, and from there, getting abstinent.  </p>
