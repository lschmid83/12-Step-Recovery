	<h3>Morning Prayer</h3>
	<p>
	  God direct my thinking today so that it be divorced of self-pity, dishonesty, self-will, self-seeking and fear.<br />
	  God inspire my thinking, decisions and intuitions. Help me to relax and take it easy.<br />
	  Free me from doubt and indecision. Guide me through this day and show me my next step.<br />
	  God give me what I need to take care of any problems.<br />
	  I ask all these things that I may be of maximum service to you and my fellow man in the name of the Steps I pray.<br />Amen
