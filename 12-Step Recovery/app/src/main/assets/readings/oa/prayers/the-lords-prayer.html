	<h3>The Lord's Prayer</h3>
	<p>
	  Our Father, who art in heaven,<br />
	  hallowed be thy name.<br />
	  Thy Kingdom come,<br />
	  thy will be done,<br />
	  on earth as it is in heaven<br />
	  Give us this day our daily bread.<br />
	  And forgive us our trespasses,<br />
	  as we forgive those who trespass against us.<br />
	  And lead us not into temptation,<br />
	  but deliver us from evil.<br />
	  For thine is the kingdom,<br />
	  the power and the glory,<br />
	  for ever and ever.<br />
	  Amen.
	</p>
