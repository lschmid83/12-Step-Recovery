	<h3>Newcomers to Overeaters Anonymous</h3>
	<h3>Welcome to Overeaters Anonymous</h3>
	<p>Welcome to Overeaters Anonymous. OA is a Fellowship of individuals who, through shared experience, strength, and hope, are recovering from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviours by working the Twelve Steps.</p>
	<p>If you have tried to achieve a healthy body weight through many methods, only to fail repeatedly, or if your inability to control you’re eating is beginning to frighten you, then please consider attending an OA meeting.</p>
	<p>At OA meetings, you will find others who have the same concerns and who share your feelings. Chances are you will find many of the answers you need. Overeaters Anonymous is a simple program that works. There are no dues or fees. We are self-supporting through our own contributions. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop eating compulsively.</p>
	<p>As a newcomer to Overeaters Anonymous, you probably have many questions about this program of recovery. What makes OA different from other programs? How can OA help you recover from compulsive eating and maintain a healthy weight when everything else you’ve tried has failed? Can OA help you stop bingeing or yo-yo dieting? How can you achieve freedom from food obsession and compulsive eating? Is there any hope? <a href="/support/contact-us#oa-contact-us-gb">Contact Us</a>.</p>
	<h3>You Are Not Alone</h3>
	<p>You are no longer alone. We, too, have experienced hopelessness when we tried to control our problems with food or eating. We have tried every diet and used many methods to control our 3 body size, without success. We could not enjoy life because of our obsession with food, weight, and/or size. We could not stop eating too much even when we really wanted to. At times, some of us even refused to eat because we were afraid we would be overcome by our appetite. We felt shame and humiliation about our behaviour with food.</p>
	<p>We are not like normal people when it comes to eating. What all of us have in common is that our bodies and minds send us signals about food which seem to be quite different from those the normal eater receives. Many of us can’t stop once we start eating, and even if we have managed to stop from time to time, we can’t keep from starting again. Some of us have repeatedly tried and failed to control other compulsive eating behaviours. So the cycle continues.</p>
	<p>In Overeaters Anonymous, we learned that we have an illness, an unhealthy condition of body and mind that can be relieved on a daily basis. OA offers a solution. We find that we no longer want to return to the foods and eating behaviours that created uncontrollable cravings. We have been released from our mental obsession. We are able to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight. For us, that is nothing less than a miracle. We have found a way to abstain from our compulsive behaviours related to food, diets, weight, exercise, and/or body image.</p>
	<p>We realized that we could not recover by ourselves, so we learned to share with other OA members. Instead of reaching for food to soothe our nerves, we went to a meeting, wrote about our feelings, read some OA literature, or called our sponsor. As we practiced these new and healthy behaviours, we began to feel safe. We found a home in the Fellowship and the support that OA offers us. We discovered that we can recover by following OA’s Twelve Steps and by reaching out to help others with the same problem.</p>
	<p>We promise that if you work the Twelve Steps to the best of your ability, regularly attend meetings, and use OA’s Tools, your life will change. You will experience what we have: the miracle of recovery from compulsive eating.</p>
	<h3>Many Symptoms, One Solution</h3>
	<p>In Overeaters Anonymous, you’ll find members who are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Extremely overweight, even morbidly obese</li>
		<li>Only moderately overweight</li>
		<li>Average weight</li>
		<li>Underweight</li>
		<li>Still maintaining periodic control over their eating behaviour</li>
		<li>Totally unable to control their compulsive eating</li>
	</ul>
	<p>OA members experience many different patterns of food behaviours. These “symptoms” are as varied as our membership. Among them are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Obsession with body weight, size, and shape</li>
		<li>Eating binges</li>
		<li>Grazing</li>
		<li>Preoccupation with reducing diets</li>
		<li>Starving</li>
		<li>Excessive exercise</li>
		<li>Inducing vomiting after eating</li>
		<li>Inappropriate and/or excessive use of diuretics and laxatives</li>
		<li>Chewing and spitting out food</li>
		<li>Use of diet pills, shots, and other medical interventions, including surgery, to control weight</li>
		<li>Inability to stop eating certain foods after taking the first bite</li>
		<li>Fantasies about food</li>
		<li>Vulnerability to quick-weight-loss schemes</li>
		<li>Constant preoccupation with food</li>
		<li>Using food as a reward or for comfort</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Our symptoms may vary, but we share a common bond: We are powerless over food and our lives are unmanageable. This common problem has led those in OA to seek and find a common solution in the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions of Overeaters Anonymous. We find that, no matter 5 what our symptoms, we all suffer from the same disease — one that can be arrested by living this program one day at a time. <br /><br /></p>
