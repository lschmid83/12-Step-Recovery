	<h3>Information about Overeaters Anonymous</h3>
	<p>Overeaters Anonymous is a Fellowship of individuals who, through shared experience, strength, and hope, are recovering from compulsive overeating. We welcome everyone who wants to stop eating compulsively. There are no dues or fees for members; we are self-supporting through our own contributions, neither soliciting nor accepting outside donations.</p>
	<p>OA is not affiliated with any public or private organization, political movement, ideology, or religious doctrine; we take no position on outside issues. Our primary purpose is to abstain from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviours and to carry the message of recovery through the Twelve Steps of OA to those who still suffer.</p>
	<p>If you have tried to achieve a healthy body weight through many methods, only to fail repeatedly, or if your inability to control your eating is beginning to frighten you, then please consider attending an OA meeting. You are no longer alone. We, too, have experienced hopelessness when we tried to control our problems with food or eating. We have tried every diet and used many methods to control our body size, without success. We could not enjoy life because of our obsession with food, weight, and/or size. We could not stop eating too much even when we really wanted to. At times, some of us even refused to eat because we were afraid we would be overcome by our appetite. We felt shame and humiliation about our behaviour with food. <a href="/leaflets/overeaters-anonymous/where-do-i-start-everything-a-newcomer-needs-to-know.pdf" target="_blank">Where Do I Start?</a></p>
	<p>Founded in 1960, the OA approach is based on the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), which focuses on physical, emotional, and spiritual elements. OA believes that compulsive eating is a disease like alcoholism, which is why it is based on the Twelve Steps of AA.</p>
	<p>At OA meetings, you will find others who have the same concerns and who share your feelings. Chances are you will find many of the answers you need. Overeaters Anonymous is a simple program that works. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop eating compulsively.</p>
	<h3>How it Works?</h3>
	<p>Overeaters Anonymous offers recovery tools for people experiencing compulsive eating, binge eating, and other eating disorders. The organization follows a 12-step approach and is cantered on group meetings and sponsors to aid with recovery.</p>
	<p>Our symptoms may vary, but we share a common bond: we are powerless over food, and our lives have become unmanageable. This common problem has led those in OA to seek and find a common solution in the Twelve Steps with the assistance of the Twelve Traditions of OA and our Nine Tools. <a href="/leaflets/overeaters-anonymous/tools-of-recovery-abridged.pdf" target="_blank">The Tools of Recovery</a>.</p>
	<p>We in OA believe we have a threefold illness — physical, emotional, and spiritual. Tens of thousands have found that OA’s Twelve Step program brings recovery on all three levels. The Twelve Steps embody a set of actions we take. These Steps put us in touch with a Higher Power who restores us to sanity. As we work the Steps, we let go of old attitudes, and we find we are being relieved of our obsession with our eating disorder. Those of us who choose to work the Steps, one day at a time, achieve a new way of life with lasting freedom from our food obsession.</p>
	<p>OA is a community of people who support each other in order to recover from compulsive eating and food behaviours. When you arrive at an OA meeting, you will find men and women who share a common problem — compulsive eating — and who have found a common solution: the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions of Overeaters Anonymous.</p>
	<p>The reasons for attendance are as diverse as the members. Some are there to determine if they have food issues, while others seek support as they recover from issues like compulsive overeating, food addiction, binge eating, and negative body image. Since OA members share a strained relationship with food, eating disorders may be common amongst OA members.</p>
	<p>As we work the Overeaters Anonymous Twelve Step program of recovery from compulsive eating, we have a number of Tools to assist us. We use these Tools — a plan of eating, sponsorship, meetings, telephone, writing, literature, action plan, anonymity, and service — on a regular basis, to help us achieve and maintain abstinence and recovery from our disease.</p>
	<h3>Meeting Formats</h3>
	<p>Meetings vary in size from as few as three members to fifteen or even more in larger towns. Many members attend more than one meeting a week. You will be warmly welcomed.</p>
	<p>The meeting usually opens with the Serenity Prayer, and you may hear a reading called “Our Invitation to You,” which describes the disease of compulsive overeating and the Twelve-Step solution. Meeting formats may vary, but all OA groups are the same in that they seek recovery on three levels — physical, emotional and spiritual — through the Twelve Steps, and the only requirement for membership is a desire to stop eating compulsively.</p>
	<p>You may hear a speaker open the meeting and speak for 10 to 15 minutes about what life was like before OA, what happened, and what he or she is like now; or someone might read from OA or AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) literature. Other members will share their experience, strength and hope. You will have an opportunity to introduce yourself as a newcomer, if you like. You will find that you are not alone, that there is a way out of your desperation.</p>
	<p>You may recognise your own story when you listen to others share. Listening will help you find others who have what you want, whether it be weight loss, clarity, joy in achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight, or freedom from the obsession of self-destructive eating behaviours.</p>
	<p>The designation of open and closed meetings have to do with the level of anonymity the group has chosen. If you think you have issues with food and are interested in exploring OA, you are welcome at any meeting — open or closed.</p>
	<p><b>Open Meeting:</b> Open to OA members and non-OA visitors. All meetings are considered open unless otherwise indicated. </p>
	<p><b>Closed Meeting:</b> Restricted to those who desire to stop eating compulsively (OA members and others who think they may have a problem with food).</p>
	<p>If you are interested in OA for another reason, like you are studying to be a nurse, doctor, or therapist, or are a concerned family member, we ask that you only attend open meetings.</p>
	<h3>Sponsorship</h3>
	<p>Sponsors are OA members who are living the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions to the best of their ability. They are willing to share their recovery with other members of the Fellowship and are committed to abstinence. Ask a member who has what you want from the program and how he or she is achieving it. A member may work with more than one sponsor and may change sponsors at will. A sponsor will work with you through the Twelve Steps of Overeaters Anonymous.</p>
	<p>Sponsors work one-on-one with another compulsive eater sharing what works for them, walking alongside their sponsees. They use and share OA Tools and slogans, study, work and apply the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, and offer support when it’s needed. This connection to a Higher Power, to spiritual Principles and practices, and to other recovering OA members — is a crucial part to recovery. <a href="/leaflets/overeaters-anonymous/a-sponsors-toolbox.pdf" target="_blank">A Sponsors Toolbox</a>.</p>
	<p>Usually the question of becoming a sponsor comes up in two ways: our own sponsor indicates that it is time, or someone asks us to sponsor them.</p>
	<p>There are no specific qualifications for sponsorship in OA. Although some members insist sponsors should have completed the first three steps, or must have completed their step four inventory, there are no such official requirements. Sponsors share their program up to the level of their own experience.</p>
	<p>A sponsor isn’t responsible for the failures or the successes of a sponsee. You can’t get someone abstinent if they don’t want to be abstinent, and you can’t prevent them from getting abstinent if they want to be abstinent. Don’t expect success; and don’t fear failure. It’s not up to you. The acceptance and practice of the OA recovery program rests entirely with the individual.</p>
	<h3>Service Commitments</h3>
	<p>Service is one of OA’s Tools of Recovery which help us achieve and maintain abstinence, and is vital in helping us fulfil our primary purpose of carrying the OA message to the compulsive eater who still suffers.</p>
	<p>Any form of service that helps a reach fellow sufferer adds to the quality of our own recovery. Members can give service by getting to meetings, putting away chairs, putting out literature, and talking to newcomers. Beyond the group level, a member can serve as intergroup representative, committee chair, region representative, or Conference delegate. As OA’s responsibility pledge states, "Always to extend the hand and heart of OA to all who share my compulsion; for this, I am responsible."</p>
	<p>The 12 Concepts of OA Service help us apply the Steps and Traditions in our service work. The Concepts define and guide the practices of the service structures that conduct the business of OA and are a useful resource for groups and Intergroups. <a href="https://oa.org/service-bodies/twelve-concepts/" target="_blank">The Twelve Concepts of OA Service</a>.</p>
	<p>You can publicise your meetings in lots of ways. The Public Information Service Manual is available to purchase from the OAGB Literature Service and contains lots of useful information and ideas about this.</p>
	<h3>Religion</h3>
	<p>OA is not a religious organization. OA members are people of many religious faiths as well as atheists and agnostics. The OA recovery program is based on acceptance of certain spiritual principles. Members are free to interpret these principles as they think best, or not to think about them at all if they so choose. <a href="https://oa.org/working-the-program/atheists-and-agnostics-are-welcome/" target="_blank">Atheists and Agnostics are Welcome</a>.</p>
	<p>Many individuals who come to OA have reservations about accepting any concept of a power greater than themselves. OA experience has shown that those who keep an open mind on this subject and continue coming to OA meetings will not find it too difficult to work out their own solution to this very personal matter.</p>
	<p>We don’t all think alike. As stated in The Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions of Overeaters Anonymous, page ix, "Our common bonds are two: the disease of compulsive eating from which we all have suffered, and the solution that we all are finding as we live by the principles embodied in these Steps." This is what unites us in OA. As the Third Tradition states, if we have the desire to stop eating compulsively, there is a place for us in OA. Anyone who has this desire is welcome and should never feel like they have to explain their personal beliefs.</p>
	<p>"Open-mindedness is key to success, as we read in The Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions of Overeaters Anonymous." OA doesn’t tell us we have to believe in God — only that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</p>
	<p>People who find success in OA work this program with their own concept of a Higher Power, regardless of their personal interpretation of that power. Clarity, peace of mind, and growth are some of the many by-products of OA’s recovery program. When we stay in the program and apply these principles in keeping with a personal understanding of a Higher Power, these rich rewards are ours! These are certainly good reasons to ‘keep coming back’.</p>
	<h3>Anonymity</h3>
	<p>Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our Traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities. Anonymity assures us that only we, as individual OA members, have the right to make our membership known to others. Anonymity at the level of press, radio, films, television, and other public media of communication means that we never allow our faces or last names to be used once we identify ourselves as OA members. <a href="/leaflets/overeaters-anonymous/guidelines-for-anonymity-in-the-digital-world.pdf" target="_blank">Guidelines for Anonymity in the Digital World</a>.</p>
	<p>Tradition Eleven addresses the need for members to be anonymous outside the Fellowship at the level of public media. By following this Tradition, we guard against the assumption that any one person’s recovery represents OA as a whole. We also guard against the temptation for an individual to seek public recognition. Members who ignore our Eleventh Tradition can cause damage to OA’s spirit of fellowship, which is essential to our personal healing. Such breaks of anonymity may bring the OA name before the public, but they can also bring jealousy and competition for publicity and financial rewards. We must be willing to surrender our need for recognition to protect our recovery and OA as a whole</p>
	<p>Within the Fellowship, anonymity means that whatever we share with another OA member will be respected and kept confidential. What we hear at meetings should remain there.</p>
