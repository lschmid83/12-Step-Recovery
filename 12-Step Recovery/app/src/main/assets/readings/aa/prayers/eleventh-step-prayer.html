	<h3>Eleventh Step Prayer</h3>
	<p>
	  Higher Power, as I understand You, I pray to keep my connection with You Open and clear from the confusion of daily life.<br />
	  Through my prayers and meditation I ask especially for Freedom from self-will, rationalization, and wishful thinking.<br />
	  I pray for the guidance of correct thought and positive action.<br />
	  Your will Higher Power, not mine, be done.<br /><br />
	  As we go through the day we pause, when agitated or doubtful, and ask for the right thought or action.<br />
	  We constantly remind ourselves we are no longer running the show, humbly saying to ourselves many times each day 'Thy will be done.'<br /><br />
	  God, I'm agitated and doubtful right now.<br />
	  Help me to stop and remember that I've made a decision to let You be my God.<br />
	  Give me the right thoughts and actions.<br />
	  God, save me from fear, anger, worry, self-pity or foolish decisions and that Your will, not my will, be done.<br />
	  Amen.<br /><br />
