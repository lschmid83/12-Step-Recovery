	<h3>Second Step Prayer</h3>
	<p>
	  Heavenly Father,  I know in my heart that only you can restore me to sanity.<br />
	  I humbly ask that you remove all twisted thought and Addictive behaviour from me this day.<br />
	  Heal my spirit and restore in me a clear mind.<br />
	  God, I'm standing at the turning point right now.<br />
	  Give me your protection and care as I abandon myself to you and give up my old ways and my old ideas just for today.<br />
	  Amen.<br /><br />
