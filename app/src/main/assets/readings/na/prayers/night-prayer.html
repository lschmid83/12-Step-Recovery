	<h3>Night Prayer</h3>
	<p>
	  God forgive me where I have been resentful, selfish, dishonest or afraid today.<br />
	  Help me to not keep anything to myself but to discuss it all openly with another person â€“ show me where I owe an apology and help me make it.<br />
	  Help me to be kind and loving to all people. Use me in the mainstream of life God.<br />
	  Remove worry, remorse or morbid reflections that I may be of usefulness to others.<br />
	  Amen.<br /><br />
