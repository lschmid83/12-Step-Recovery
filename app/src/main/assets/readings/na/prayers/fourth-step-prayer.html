	<h3>Fourth Step Prayer</h3>
	<p>
	  Dear God, It is I who has made my life a mess. I have done it, but I cannot undo it.<br />
	  My mistakes are mine and I will begin a searching and fearless moral inventory.<br />
	  I will write down my wrongs. But I will also include that which is good.<br />
	  I pray for the strength to complete the task.<br />
	  Amen.
	<p>
	<p>
	  <b>When in Doubt</b><br /><br />
	  "I am to sit quietly when in doubt, asking only for direction and strength to meet my problems as He would have me.<br />
	  Never am I to pray for myself, except as my requests bore on my usefulness to others.<br />
	  Then only might I expect to receive.<br />
	  But that would be in great measure."<br />
	  Amen.<br /><br />

	  <b>When I am Disturbed by the Conduct (Symptoms) of Others</b><br /><br />
	  "This is a sick man.<br />
	  How can I be helpful to him? God save me from being angry.<br />
	  Thy will be done."<br />
	  Amen.<br /><br />
	  (Page. 67 Big Book)<br /><br />
	  God, help me to show this person the same tolerance, pity and patience that I would cheerfully grant a sick friend.<br />
	  This is a sick person, how can I be helpful to him?<br />
	  God save me from being angry.<br />
	  Thy will be done.<br />
	  Amen.<br /><br />

	  <b>When I am Afraid</b><br /><br />
	  We ask Him to remove our fear and direct our attention to what He would have us be.<br />
	  God, relieve me of His fear and direct my attention to what you would have me be.<br />
	  Amen.<br /><br />

	  <b>When I am Aware of my Own Defects and Seeking Gods Help to Change</b><br /><br />
	  We asked God to mould our ideals and help us to live up to them,<br />
	  we ask God what we should do about each specific matter.<br /><br />
	  God, mould my ideals in this particular area of my life and help me to live up to them.<br />
	  What should I do in each specific matter?<br />
	  Guide me God and give me strength to do right.<br />
	  Amen.<br /><br />
