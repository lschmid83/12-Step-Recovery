	<h3>Addiction Self Assessments for Alcoholics Anonymous</h3>
	<p>Only you can decide whether you want to give A.A. a try and whether you think it can help you.  Below are some questions we tried to answer honestly.  See how you do.  There is no disgrace in facing up to the fact that you have a problem.</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Have you ever decided to give up drinking but only managed to last a few days?</li>
	<li>Have you ever had a loss of memory because of drinking?</li>
	<li>Have you ever tried switching from one kind of drink to another in an effort to control your drinking?</li>
	<li>Do you often want to continue drinking after your friends say they have had enough?</li>
	<li>Do you hide alcohol or drink in secret?</li>
	<li>When drinking with other people do you try to have a few extra drinks which they don’t know about?</li>
	<li>Do you crave alcohol, and have a sense of relief once you have had a drink?</li>
	<li>Have you ever tried to stop your drinking and been unsuccessful?</li>
	<li>After drinking have you ever felt remorseful and made a resolution not to drink again?</li>
	<li>Do you drink to make you feel normal?</li>
	<li>Have you ever tried to control your drinking?</li>
	<li>Do you get to the point where you forget or don’t care about the negative consequences of drinking, or think ‘this time it will be different’?</li>
	</ol>
	<p>If you have answered YES to any one of the questions, you may be in trouble with alcohol, the more questions you answered YES to, the greater the chance that you could be an alcoholic.</p>
	<p>Why do we say this? Because many members in AA have had these very experiences and found out the truth about their alcoholism.</p>
