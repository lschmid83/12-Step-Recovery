	<h3>Anonymity Statement</h3>
	<p>There may be some here who are not familiar with our Tradition of personal anonymity at the public level:</p>
	<p>"Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio and films."</p>
	<p>We respectfully ask that A.A. speakers and A.A. members not be photo-graphed, videoed, or identified by full name on all media platforms or in any published reports of our meetings, including those reports on public media platforms.</p>
	<p>The assurance of anonymity is essential in our efforts to help other problem drinkers who may wish to share our recovery program with us. And our Tradition of anonymity reminds us that A.A. principles come before personalities.</p>
