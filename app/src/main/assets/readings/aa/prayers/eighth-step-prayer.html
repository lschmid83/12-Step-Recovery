	<h3>Eighth Step Prayer</h3>
	<p>
	  Higher Power, I ask Your help in making my list of all those I have harmed.<br />
	  I will take responsibility for my mistakes and Be forgiving to others as You are forgiving to me.<br />
	  Grant me the willingness to begin my restitution.<br />
	  This I pray.<br /><br />
	  "We attempt to sweep away the debris which has accumulated out of our effort to live on self-will and run the show ourselves.<br />
	  If we haven't the will to do this, we ask until it comes."<br /><br />
	  God help me to become willing to sweep away the debris of self will and self-reliant living.
	  Thy will be done for his person as well as for me.<br />
	  Amen.<br /><br />
