	<h3>Third Step Prayer</h3>
	<p>
	  God, I offer myself to Thee to build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt.<br />
	  Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy will.<br />
	  Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love, and Thy Way of life.<br />
	  May I do Thy will always!<br />
	  God, Take my will and my life. Guide me in my recovery. Show me how to live.<br />
	  Amen.<br /><br />
