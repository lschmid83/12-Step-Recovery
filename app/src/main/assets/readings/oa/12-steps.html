	<h3>The 12-Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous</h3>
	<p>The 12-Steps were created by the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous to establish guidelines to overcome an addiction to alcohol. The program gained enough success in its early years for other addiction support groups to adapt the steps to their specific substance or addictive behavior.</p>
	<p>The 12-Steps are outlined in the book Alcoholics Anonymous. They can be found at the beginning of the chapter "How It Works." Essays on the Steps can be read in the book Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions.</p>
	<p>There are many 12-step programs for various addictions and compulsive behaviors, ranging from Alcoholics Anonymous to Overeaters Anonymous — all using the same 12-Step methods.</p>
	<p>Although the 12-Steps are based on spiritual principles, many nonreligious people have found the program immensely helpful. The language emphasizes the presence of God as each participant understands God, allowing for different interpretations and religious beliefs.</p>
	<p>Many members of 12-step recovery programs have found that these steps were not merely a way to overcome addiction, but they became a guide toward a new way of life.</p>
	<p>The relative success of the AA program seems to be due to the fact that an alcoholic who no longer drinks has an exceptional faculty for "reaching" and helping an uncontrolled drinker,</p>
	<p>In simplest form, the AA program operates when a recovered alcoholic passes along the story of his or her own problem drinking, describes the sobriety he or she has found in AA, and invites the newcomer to join the informal Fellowship.</p>
	<p>The heart of the suggested program of personal recovery is contained in Twelve Steps describing the experience of the earliest members of the Society:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>We admitted we were powerless over alcohol — that our lives had become unmanageable.</li>
	<li>Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</li>
	<li>Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.</li>
	<li>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.</li>
	<li>Admitted to God, to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.</li>
	<li>Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.</li>
	<li>Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.</li>
	<li>Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.</li>
	<li>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.</li>
	<li>Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.</li>
	<li>Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</li>
	<li>Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Newcomers are not asked to accept or follow these Twelve Steps in their entirety if they feel unwilling or unable to do so.</p>
	<p>They will usually be asked to keep an open mind, to attend meetings at which recovered alcoholics describe their personal experiences in achieving sobriety, and to read AA literature describing and interpreting the AA program.</p>
	<p>AA members will usually emphasize to newcomers that only problem drinkers themselves, individually, can determine whether or not they are in fact alcoholics.</p>
	<p>At the same time, it will be pointed out that all available medical testimony indicates that alcoholism is a progressive illness, that it cannot be cured in the ordinary sense of the term, but that it can be arrested through total abstinence from alcohol in any form.</p>
