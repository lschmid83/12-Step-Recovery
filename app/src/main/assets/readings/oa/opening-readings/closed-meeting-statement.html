	<h3>Closed Meeting Statement</h3>
	<p>This is a closed meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. In support of A.Aâ€™s singleness of purpose, attendance at closed meetings is limited to persons who have a desire to stop drinking. If you think you have a problem with alcohol, you are welcome to attend this meeting. We ask that when discussing our problems, we confine ourselves to those problems as they relate to alcoholism.</p>
