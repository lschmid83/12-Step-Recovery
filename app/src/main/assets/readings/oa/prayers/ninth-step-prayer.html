	<h3>Ninth Step Prayer</h3>
	<p>
	  Higher Power, I pray for the right attitude to make my amends,<br />
	  Being ever mindful not to harm others in the process.<br />
	  I ask for Your guidance in making indirect amends. Most important,<br />
	  I will continue to make amends By staying abstinent, helping others and Growing in spiritual progress.<br /><br />
	  God, give me the strength and direction to do the right thing no matter what the consequences may be.
	  Help me to consider others and not harm them in any way.<br />
	  Help me to consult with others before I take any actions that would cause me to be sorry.<br />
	  Help me to not repeat such behaviours.<br />
	  Show me the way of Patience, Tolerance, Kindliness, and Love and help me live the spiritual life.<br />
	  Amen.<br /><br />
