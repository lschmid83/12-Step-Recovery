	<h3>Serenity Prayer</h3>
	<p>
	  God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,<br />
	  The courage to change the things I can,<br />
	  And the wisdom to know the difference.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Living one day at a time;<br />
	  Enjoying one moment at a time;<br />
	  Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace;<br />
	  Taking, as He did, this sinful world<br />As it is, not as I would have it;
	  <br />Trusting that He will make things right<br />
	  If I surrender to His Will;<br />
	  So that I may be reasonably happy in this life<br />
	  And supremely happy with Him<br />Forever and ever in the next.
	  <br />Amen.
	</p>
