	<h3>Seventh Step Prayer</h3>
	<p>
	  "I humbly offered myself to God, as I then understood Him, to do with me as He would.<br />
	  I placed myself unreservedly under His care and direction.<br />
	  I admitted for the first time that of myself I was nothing; that without Him I was lost.<br />
	  I ruthlessly faced my sins and became willing to have my new-found Friend take them away, root and branch."<br /><br />
	  My Creator, I am now willing that you should have all of me, good and bad.<br />
	  I pray that you now remove from me every single defect of character which stands in the way of my usefulness to you and my fellows.<br />
	  Grant me strength, as I go out from here to do Your bidding.<br />
	  Amen.<br /><br />
