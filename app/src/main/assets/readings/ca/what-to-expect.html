	<h3 id="aa-what-to-expect">What to Expect at Cocaine Anonymous</h3>
	<h3>What is the First Thing?</h3>
	<p>To the newcomer who wonders about the first thing he or she must do to achieve sobriety, we say that you have already done the first thing: you have admitted to yourself, and now to others, that you need help by the very act of coming to a meeting or seeking information about the C.A. program.</p>
	<p>You are at this very moment doing what is necessary to stay sober: you’re not getting loaded. Cocaine Anonymous is a one-day-at-a-time program. We suggest that you not dwell on wanting to stay sober for the rest of your life, or for a year, or even a week. Once you have decided you want to quit, let tomorrow take care of itself. But sometimes it is too much for us to project even one whole day drug-free. That’s okay. Take recovery a day at a time, an hour a time, or even a minute at a time if necessary.</p>
	<p>In the C.A. Fellowship, you are among addicts who are living without drugs. Make use of us! Take phone numbers. Between meetings, you may not be able to avoid contact with drugs and people who are still using. Some of us had no sober friends at all when we first came in. You have sober friends now! If you begin to feel restless, irritable and discontented, don’t wait. Give one of us a call, and don’t be surprised if one of us calls you when we need help!</p>
	<p>It may surprise you that we discourage the use of any mind-altering substances, including alcohol and marijuana. It is the common experience of addicts in this and other programs that any drug use leads to relapse or substitute addiction. If you’re addicted to another substance, you’d better take care of it. If you’re not, then you don’t need it, so why mess with it? We urge you to heed this sound advice drawn from the bitter experience of other addicts. Is it likely you’re different?</p>
	<p>We thought we were happy in our active addiction, but we were not. In C.A., we learn to live a new way of life. Cocaine Anonymous is a spiritual but not a religious program—our spiritual values are accessible to everyone.</p>
	<p>We who are grateful recovering addicts ask you to listen closely to our stories. That is the main thing — listen! We know where you’re coming from, because we’ve been there ourselves. Yet we are now living drug-free, not only that, but living happily; many of us, happier than we have ever been before.</p>
	<p>No one says that it is easy to arrest addiction. We had to give up old ways of thinking and behaving. We had to be willing to change. But we are doing it, gratefully, one day at a time.</p>
	<h3>Meeting Types</h3>
	<p>CA meetings are hosted daily in many parts of the across the globe, and online. When joining Cocaine Anonymous, people typically find a group in their local community. This group is considered the Home Group and is the group they regularly attend. There are open and closed meetings. Open meetings can be attended by anyone interested in Cocaine Anonymous, including individuals coping with cocaine addictions and family members and friends of these individuals. Closed meetings are reserved for Cocaine Anonymous members only.</p>
	<p>There are a variety of meeting types that groups may use. For example, every so often a group may need a “service” meeting where they discuss the way the group is run and any business needs. Other CA meeting types may include “book study,” “discussion,” “step study,” “H & I Meeting,” or “speaker.” Both book and step study group meetings will focus on CA literature or the 12 Steps and working through them, while a speaker meeting usually has one or two prearranged members speaking on a particular topic or experience. Discussion meetings are the traditional meeting types, while H & I meetings may be hosted at treatment facilities and be specifically for people who are receiving care there.</p>
	<h3>Benefits of Cocaine Anonymous</h3>
	<p>Cocaine Anonymous is a no-cost, widely available resource open to anyone who has the desire to stop using cocaine. Cocaine Anonymous incorporates principles of spirituality but does not focus on one religion; thus, people from all religious and non-religious backgrounds should feel welcome. Individual therapy and 12-step programs are essential resources for recovery.</p>
	<p>Research conducted in relation to Alcoholics Anonymous suggests that people who participated in individual addiction treatment followed by long-term involvement in a 12-step program were more likely to be in remission 16 years later compared to those who only pursued one or the other. Joining a 12-step program like Cocaine Anonymous after completing initial rehabilitation can be a useful resource for maintaining abstinence and is frequently encouraged as part of many addiction recovery treatment plans.</p>
	<p>Cocaine Anonymous offers a community of people who are working toward the same goal abstinence from cocaine. Receiving support from others who have gone through, or are going through similar experiences is a valuable component of recovery. Research supports the fellowship or community cultivated among members all coping with the same issue as a primary reason that 12-step programs are effective for long-term abstinence.</p>
	<h3>What Happens at Meetings?</h3>
	<p>Cocaine Anonymous follows the concept that people are powerless over addiction and drug use, and only by accepting this and turning over their lives to a higher power can they be healed. CA is nondenominational and does not follow any specific religion, although there is a definite spiritual aspect to it. Members are encouraged to work through the 12 Steps, which involve accepting one’s faults, admitting wrongdoing and making amends, turning life over to one’s higher power, experiencing a spiritual awakening, and providing service to others in need of help achieving sobriety.</p>
	<p>Meetings are welcoming and non-judgmental, and attendance is kept confidential. Individuals can attend any, and as many, meetings as they wish, and Cocaine Anonymous encourages those battling cocaine addiction to find a “home group” that they are comfortable with and attend regularly. A home group can help individuals new to CA by providing sponsorship until a specific sponsor is set up for them. A sponsor is an individual in more sustained recovery who works with a new member to offer support.</p>
	<p>A CA meeting usually lasts about an hour and may follow this general format:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Welcome with a prayer or a reading from the Big Book</li>
	<li>Announcements or information on CA Worldwide</li>
	<li>Proclamation to keep all information that is shared confidential</li>
	<li>Discussion time where individuals can share their personal experiences if they wish to, although no one is required to share</li>
	<li>Refreshments and social time</li>
	<li>Passing the collection plate (meetings are free; donations are only recommended, not required)</li>
	<li>Closing with a prayer or moment of silence</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Each CA group is autonomous, meaning that each operates independently and is self-sufficient. Groups are funded through donations by members, and no outside contributions or influence is allowed.</p>
	<p>One of the most important aspects of CA is related to service. Members are encouraged to find some way to serve the group, either by taking a service position within the group or agreeing to be in charge of making or cleaning up the coffee and snacks before or after a meeting. This provides individuals with a sense of purpose and belonging, and ensures everyone contributes to the good of the group.</p>
	<h3>Who Should Go to CA Meetings?</h3>
	<p>Cocaine can provide people with a temporary escape from reality and an artificial spike in energy, focus, and pleasure. It also makes them seem more social and talkative. Cocaine may be used as a way to cope with stress or other painful emotions. When cocaine use is stopped, a person may feel tired, lethargic, unhappy, and isolated.</p>
	<p>Cocaine Anonymous can offer social and emotional support from other individuals who have been there and understand. A sense of community is formed, giving individuals the social network they may feel was lost when they stopped using drugs. These bonds can be lasting, as CA members work together to achieve the common goal of sobriety and maintained abstinence. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) defines hope as being one of the foundations of recovery. Cocaine Anonymous may help individuals to find and expand upon that hope.</p>
	<p>Stress is a common trigger for substance abuse. By working through the steps taught in CA meetings, participants can learn new coping mechanisms and techniques for managing stressors that don’t involve cocaine or any substance use. Peer support and peer pressure can be powerful, and CA is a network of peers that provide healthy peer pressure and a level of support that others who haven’t experienced cocaine addiction may not completely understand.</p>
	<p>A return to drug use after a period of being sober is called relapse, and this is common during recovery. Relapse may be especially dangerous in the case of cocaine abuse, as individuals may return to using the drug at levels they were used to before getting sober. This may overwhelm the system and cause a potentially life-threatening overdose. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) reported that in 2014, close to 6,000 Americans died from a cocaine overdose. Relapse may be minimized and the potential outcome positively influenced by regular participation in a support group like Cocaine Anonymous.</p>
	<p>Members of CA can be there for each other, provide tips for controlling drug cravings, and help each other from returning to cocaine use. Complete abstinence from abusing mind-altering substances is one of the overarching themes and goals of 12-Step programs. Active involvement and participation in a self-help and peer support group like CA can reduce relapse and increase the chances that someone will remain abstinent, the Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment publishes.</p>
	<h3 id="ca-finding-a-group">Finding a CA Group</h3>
	<p>CA groups exist in more than 20 countries, and there are even options to join online meetings as well. This website provides a directory of Cocaine Anonymous meetings in the UK.</p>
	<p>Substance abuse treatment providers and facilities are also great resources for helping individuals and families find CA meetings that are local. In addition, primary care providers and mental health professionals can offer referrals to local meetings.</p>
	<p>Individuals do not have to do anything prior to a meeting; just show up to a scheduled meeting. CA meetings are open not only to individuals struggling with cocaine addiction, but also to those who abuse other mind-altering substances.</p>
