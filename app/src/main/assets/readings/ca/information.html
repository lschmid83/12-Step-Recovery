	<h3>Information about Cocaine Anonymous</h3>
    <p>Cocaine Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other so that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from their addiction. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop using cocaine and all other mind-altering substances. There are no dues or fees for membership; we are fully self-supporting through our own contributions. <a href="/leaflets/cocaine-anonymous/CA_What_Is_CA_2017.pdf" target="_blank">What is CA?</a></p>
    <p>CA is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organisation, or institution. We do not wish to engage in any controversy and we neither endorse nor oppose any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay free from cocaine and all other mind-altering substances, and to help others achieve the same freedom.</p>
    <p>There are no dues or fees of any kind. To be a member, you only have to want to quit. The only purpose of Cocaine Anonymous is to offer recovery to individuals who are suffering from addiction. Our experience has shown that the most effective way to attain and maintain sobriety is to work with others suffering from the same malady.</p>
    <h3>How it Works?</h3>
    <p>CA is a non-profit organization that follows the guidelines of the 12 Steps and 12 traditions outlined by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)</a> for becoming and remaining abstinent. Many years of experience have demonstrated the value of one addict helping another. CA is a fellowship of addicts who meet together to share our hope, faith, and courage for the purpose of staying sober and helping others achieve the same freedom.</p>
    <p>The only requirement for attending a CA meeting is that the person wants to stop using, or continue abstaining from, cocaine or other psychoactive substances. CA provides fellowship and a high level of social support that can help individuals struggling with cocaine addiction to sustain long-term recovery that is free from cocaine and drug abuse.</p>
    <p>CA follows the concept that people are powerless over addiction and drug use, and only by accepting this and turning over their lives to a higher power of their own understanding can they be healed completely. <a href="/leaflets/cocaine-anonymous/CA_First_30_Days_2017.pdf" target="_blank">The First 30 Days</a>.</p>
    <h3 >Meeting Formats</h3>
	<p>CA meetings are held all over the world, and there are no requirements in order to attend or join a group. No fees are collected, no paperwork is required, and signing up is unnecessary. Anyone is welcome at a meeting regardless of social status, age, ethnicity, gender, religion, or professional affiliations. <a href="/leaflets/cocaine-anonymous/CA_Yes_You_Can_Start_2017.pdf" target="_blank">Yes, You Can Start A CA Meeting</a>.</p>
    <p>A typical meeting will be either <b>"open"</b>, meaning that anyone – including friends, families, and caregivers can attend, providing they keep to the tradition of anonymity, or a <b>"closed"</b>, meaning it is only meant for those battling cocaine addiction themselves.</p>
    <p>There are a variety of meeting types that groups may use. For example, every so often a group may need a "service" meeting where they discuss the way the group is run and any business needs. Other CA meeting types may include "book study", "discussion", "step study", "H & I Meeting", or "speaker." Both book and step study group meetings will focus on CA literature or the 12 Steps and working through them, while a speaker meeting usually has one or two prearranged members speaking on a particular topic or experience. Discussion meetings are the traditional meeting types, while H & I meetings may be hosted at treatment facilities and be specifically for people who are receiving care there.</p>
    <p>Newcomers are welcomed to CA with more genuine warmth and acceptance in our hearts than you can probably now imagine — for you are the lifeblood of our program. In great part, it is by carrying the message of recovery to others like ourselves that we keep our own sobriety. We are all helping ourselves by helping each other. <a href="/leaflets/cocaine-anonymous/CA_To_The_Newcomer_2017.pdf" target="_blank">To The Newcomer</a>.</p>
    <p>Individuals can attend any, and as many, meetings as they wish, and Cocaine Anonymous encourages those battling cocaine addiction to find a “home group” that they are comfortable with and attend regularly. A home group can help individuals new to CA by providing sponsorship until a specific sponsor is set up for them. A sponsor is an individual in more sustained recovery who works with a new member to offer support. <a href="/leaflets/cocaine-anonymous/CA_The_Home_Group_2017.pdf" target="_blank">The Home Group</a>.</p>
    <p>Each CA group is autonomous, meaning that each operates independently and is self-sufficient. Groups are funded through donations by members, and no outside contributions or influence is allowed.</p>
    <h3>Sponsorship</h3>
    <p>You’ve likely heard lots of talk at Cocaine Anonymous meetings about working the Twelve Steps of recovery, finding a Power greater than ourselves, and getting a sponsor. If you’re like most newcomers, however, you’re probably not sure what all these terms mean.</p>
    <p>This is why it’s a good idea to get a sponsor. A sponsor can devote individual attention to answering your questions regarding the CA program of recovery. It can also help you feel more comfortable to be with someone who knows his or her way around. A sponsor can introduce you to other CA members, help you get involved in service and encourage you to participate in Fellowship events, all of which are vital to a successful program of recovery. <a href="/leaflets/cocaine-anonymous/CA_Choosing_Your_Sponsor_2017.pdf" target="_blank">Choosing Your Sponsor</a>.</p>
    <p>A sponsor is a recovering addict who shares one-on-one how to maintain sobriety by working the Twelve Steps of CA A sponsor’s primary tools are his or her own experience, strength and hope. Sponsors are not professional counsellors and are not certified to offer legal, psychiatric or medical advice. Nor should we become dependent on our sponsors to get us jobs, clothing or food. However, sponsors may have experience with how to obtain professional help or other resources.</p>
    <h3>Service Commitments</h3>
    <p>One of the most important aspects of CA is related to service. Members are encouraged to find some way to serve the group, either by taking a service position within the group or agreeing to be in charge of making or cleaning up the coffee and snacks before or after a meeting or sponsorship positions. This provides individuals with a sense of purpose and belonging, and ensures everyone contributes to the good of the group. <a href="/leaflets/cocaine-anonymous/CA_Being_of_Service_2017.pdf" target="_blank">Being of Service</a>.</p>
    <p>We came into the program with big egos but little or no self-esteem. We thought we were better than other people yet, at the same time, felt "less than." We were people who took from others and abused friendships all of our lives. We had no concept of doing anything for anyone without the thought of some kind of reward. By the sheer grace of our fellowship, we have found several ways of unlearning such behaviour in the program. One way is to be of service to the fellowship of Cocaine Anonymous. We discovered that the best way was to serve our fellow humans, and we found humility in the process. Our self-centred behaviour was gradually replaced with the "attitude of service." We learned that service is about gratitude and learning how to contribute to our lives and the lives of others.</p>
    <h3>Religion</h3>
    <p>CA is nondenominational and does not follow any specific religion, although there is a definite spiritual aspect to it. Members are encouraged to work through the 12 Steps, which involve accepting one’s faults, admitting wrongdoing and making amends, turning life over to one’s higher power, experiencing a spiritual awakening, and providing service to others in need of help achieving sobriety. <a href="/leaflets/cocaine-anonymous/CA_A_Higher_Power_2017.pdf" target="_blank">A Higher Power</a>.</p>
    <p>In order to maintain our integrity and avoid any possible complications, we are not affiliated with any outside organization. Although CA is a spiritual program, we do not align ourselves with any religion. Our members are free to define their spirituality as they see fit. </p>
    <h2 id="ca-anonymity">Anonymity</h2>
    <p>In CA we are all on equal footing. We are men and women of all ages, races and social backgrounds, with the common bond of addiction. Everything heard at our meetings is to be treated as confidential. Meetings are welcoming and non-judgmental, and things mentioned or talked about during the meeting, and attendance should be confidential and anonymous. <a href="/leaflets/cocaine-anonymous/CA_Anonymity_2017.pdf" target="_blank">Anonymity</a>.</p>
    <p>One definition of “anonymous” is “nameless.” Anonymity is vital to the continued growth and existence of Cocaine Anonymous, and the Fellowship’s name contains an implicit promise of privacy. By treating who we see and what we hear at our meetings as confidential, CA remains a safe place to share our experience, strength and hope.</p>
    <p>We may exchange phone numbers, and give and seek support from one another between meetings but remain focused on keeping our anonymity.</p>
