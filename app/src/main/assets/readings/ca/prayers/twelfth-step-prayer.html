	<h3>Twelfth Step Prayer</h3>
	<p>
	  Dear God, My spiritual awakening continues to unfold.<br />
	  The help I have received I shall pass on and give to others, Both in and out of the Fellowship.<br />
	  For this opportunity I am grateful.<br />
	  I pray most humbly to continue walking day by day On the road of spiritual progress.<br />
	  I pray for the inner strength and wisdom To practice the principles of this way of life in all I do and say.<br />
	  I need You, my friends, and the program every hour of every day.<br />
	  This is a better way to live.<br />
	  Amen.<br /><br />
	</p>
