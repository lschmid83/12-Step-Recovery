	<h3>Tenth Step Prayer</h3>
	<p>
	  I pray I may continue: To grow in understanding and effectiveness;<br />
	  To take daily spot check inventories of myself;<br />
	  To correct mistakes when I make them; To take responsibility for my actions;<br />
	  To be ever aware of my negative and Self - defeating attitudes and behaviours;<br />
	  To keep my wilfulness in check; To always remember I need Your help;<br />
	  To keep love and tolerance of others as my code; and To continue in daily prayer how I can best serve You, My Higher Power.<br /><br />
	  God, remove the Selfishness, dishonesty, resentment and fear that has cropped up in my life right now.<br />
	  Help me to discuss this with someone immediately and make amends quickly if I have harmed anyone.<br />
	  Help me to cease fighting anything and anyone. Show me where I may be helpful to someone else.<br />
	  Help me react sanely; not cocky or afraid.<br />
	  How can I best serve You â€” Your will, not mine be done<br /><br />
	  "How can I best serve Thee. Thy will (not mine) be done."<br />
	  Amen.<br /><br />
