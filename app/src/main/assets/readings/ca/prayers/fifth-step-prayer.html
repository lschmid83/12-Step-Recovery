	<h3>Fifth Step Prayer</h3>
	<p>
	  Higher Power, My inventory has shown me who I am,<br />
	  Yet I ask for Your help In admitting my wrongs to another person and to You.<br />
	  Assure me, and be with me, in this Step,<br />
	  For without this Step I cannot progress in my recovery.<br />
	  With Your help, I can do this, and I do it.<br /><br />
	  God, I thank you from the bottom of my heart that I know you better.<br />
	  Help me become aware of anything I have omitted discussing with another person.<br />
	  Help me to do what is necessary to walk a free man at last.<br />
	  Amen.<br /><br />
